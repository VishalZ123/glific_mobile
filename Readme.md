## Developer Guidelines

### Theme Constants Usage

Import the project theme constants from the constants folder:

```sh
import { COLORS, SIZES, FONTS, SCALE } from '/path/to/constants';
```

Here are the project theme constants available for usage:

- **COLORS**: Contains color-related constants, ex. `COLORS.primary400`.
- **SIZES**: Includes size-related constants, ex. `SIZES.m10`, `SIZES.r4` etc.
- **FONTS**: Provides font-related constants, ex. `...FONTS.regular14`.
- **SCALE**: Offers custom scaling constants which are not included in SIZES for text and other UI elements, ex. `SCALE(100)`.

Refer to the /constants/theme.ts file containing the project theme constants.

### Naming Convention for testID and class

- For `testID` and `class` attributes used in your code, follow the camelCase naming convention.
- Use lowercase for the first letter of the attribute name and capitalize the first letter of subsequent words within the name.

Example:

```jsx
// Correct:
<View testID="myElement" className="myComponent" />

// Incorrect:
<View testID="my_element" className="my_component" />
<View testID="my element" className="my-component" />
```

Following these guidelines helps to ensure a smoother development process and easier maintenance.
